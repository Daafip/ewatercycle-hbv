This package is based on the [Leaky bucket](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-leakybucket/tree/main) & is a wrapper for the [HBV-bmi](https://github.com/Daafip/HBV-bmi) model. 

HBV (Hydrologiska Byr√•ns Vattenbalansavdelning) is a conceptual hydrological model. For more information on it's history, see this [paper](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/1371/2022/).

This current implementation is _without_ a snow reservoir.

```console
pip install ewatercycle-hbv
